"""The row ceiling a shared deployment runs behind.

Entities are not rows. A row is one entity at one cut-off, so an entity count is
separated from the row count by the number of periods — and by `originations`,
which add entities as the pool ages and live in the spec the browser posts. A
deployment that caps entities has therefore capped nothing in particular, which
is what these tests exist to stop anyone assuming again.

The ceiling is enforced inside the ageing loop against the running count, not
projected from the request, because a projection would have to model
originations, terminal-state exits and the scenario overlay — and a projection
that is wrong is worse than no limit at all, since it reads as one.
