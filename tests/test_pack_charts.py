"""Charts a pack asks for.

The four drawn until now were fixed in the browser and named for a mortgage: a
delinquency curve and a loan-to-value distribution. A CLO run drew both, and
neither means anything for a corporate loan — there is no LTV, and the ladder is
watchlist and distress rather than days past due.

§18 asks for chart definitions selectable by pack, and explicitly not for a
branch on the pack's name in the interface. So a pack declares what it wants and
the fallback stays generic: it sniffs columns, it never asks which pack it is.
