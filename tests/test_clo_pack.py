"""The European CLO pack.

A trading portfolio of corporate loans, which differs from the two consumer
packs in four ways that these tests pin: the balance is bullet rather than
amortising, the pool reinvests and then stops, the ladder is a credit ladder
rather than a delinquency one, and facilities reach the end of their own term.

What this pack does *not* model is as important as what it does. There is one
obligor per facility, so nothing here measures obligor concentration, and the
rating is derived from the credit state rather than migrated by its own matrix.
Both are recorded in `test_the_pack_does_not_overclaim`.
