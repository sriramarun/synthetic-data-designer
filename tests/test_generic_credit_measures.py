"""The three figures §17 marks P1, and the sector overlay §16 asks for.

§17 warns off reproducing a rating agency's calculations. That warning is the
design constraint here, not an afterthought, and it is what these tests check as
much as the arithmetic:

  * **Average credit factor** stands in for a weighted average rating. The
    factors are not any agency's published table — each is the probability that
    *this pack's own* rating chain reaches default within five years from that
    grade, times 10,000. Reproducible from the pack file and nothing else.
  * **Effective obligors** stands in for a diversity score. It is the inverse
    Herfindahl — one over the sum of squared shares — which is ordinary
    statistics rather than anyone's model, and reads as a count so it can be
    compared directly against the plain obligor number.
  * **Portfolio turnover** has no agency equivalent and is simply how much of
    the book left since the last cut-off.

The sector overlay is the other half: `default_multiplier` moves the whole book
at once, which is not how a downturn arrives, and leaves every concentration
figure identical however severe it is set.
