"""Structure the profiler used to throw away.

Three things the designer can express and the profiler could not read back:
maturity as a rule rather than a chance, a second state machine running beside
the lifecycle, and the parent record several entities share. A relearned CLO had
flat-rate maturity, no rating migration, and one company per facility.

The CLO pack is the fixture throughout because it is the only pack that declares
all three. The other two packs are just as important, in the opposite direction:
they declare none of it, so anything found in them is a false positive — and
false positives here are worse than misses. A missed group is visible in the
spec and can be added by hand; a spurious one silently corrupts every
concentration figure the book is measured on, and looks plausible doing it.
