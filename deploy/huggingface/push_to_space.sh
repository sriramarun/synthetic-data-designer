#
# A Space is its own git repo. This assembles one from the project — the source,
# the packs, the packaging metadata — plus the two files a Space needs at its
# root: a Dockerfile, and a README whose front-matter tells Spaces to build it.
#
# The Space's README is *not* this project's README. It is the card visitors
# land on, and it leads with the fact that a hosted instance is shared, because
# the app itself promises the opposite when you run it locally.
#
# Requires: git, and `hf auth login` with write access to the target.

A Docker Space is not on the free tier. Personal accounts need PRO
(https://huggingface.co/pro); organisations need Team or Enterprise
(https://huggingface.co/enterprise). Free covers Static Spaces only, which
cannot run a Python server.

The Dockerfile beside this script is a plain one and runs anywhere — see
docs/DEPLOYMENT.md for hosts that do have a free tier.
