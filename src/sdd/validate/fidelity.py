"""How closely does the synthetic data resemble the sample it was built from?

Invariants ask "is this internally consistent?". Fidelity asks "does it look
like the real thing?" — a different question, and the one that decides whether a
generated tape is usable for pretraining or back-testing.

Four measures, each chosen because it is interpretable rather than merely
computable:

**KS distance** (numeric columns)
    The largest gap between the two cumulative distributions, from 0 (identical)
    to 1 (no overlap). 0.02 means the worst-matched percentile is off by two
    percentage points.

**Total-variation distance** (categorical columns)
    Half the sum of absolute differences in category shares, again 0 to 1. 0.01
    means you would have to move 1% of the rows to make the mixes match.

**Correlation delta**
    The largest change in any pairwise correlation. Marginals can match
    perfectly while the joint structure is wrong; this is what catches that.

**Transition delta** (panels only)
    The largest change in any state-to-state transition probability. Two panels
    can have identical delinquency *mixes* and completely different dynamics.

All four are "smaller is better" and share a scale, so one table reads across
every column type without needing a statistics background.

Each column's threshold is raised to its **noise floor** — the distance two
samples drawn from the *same* distribution would typically reach at these row
counts. Without that, the measures would report on sample size rather than on
fidelity: at 20k rows a 40-category column lands ~0.02 apart by pure chance
while a 2-category flag lands under 0.005, so any single flat threshold is
simultaneously too strict for one and too lax for the other. The raw distance
is always reported alongside, so nothing is hidden by the adjustment.

    """The TV distance two samples from the *same* mix typically reach.

    This matters more than it sounds. TV noise grows with the number of
    categories: a 40-region column drawn twice from one distribution lands
    around 0.02 apart at 20k rows purely by chance, while a 2-category flag
    lands under 0.005. A single flat threshold would therefore flag every
    high-cardinality column as a fidelity failure and pass every low-cardinality
    one regardless of how wrong it was.

    Each category's share differs by a half-normal amount with standard
    deviation ``sqrt(p(1-p)(1/n + 1/m))``, so the *expected* total is
    ``0.5 * sqrt(2/pi) * sqrt(1/n + 1/m) * sum_i sqrt(p_i(1-p_i))``.

    ``multiple`` turns that expectation into a tolerance. It must exceed 1: half
    of all columns land above their own expected noise by chance, so a threshold
    set at the mean would fail roughly half of a perfectly good dataset.

    The default of 3 was measured, not assumed. Over 868 same-generator column
    comparisons on the RMBS pack (28 seed pairs, 20k rows), the ratio of
    observed distance to expected noise had a median of 0.99 — confirming the
    formula above — but a far heavier tail than a concentration argument would
    suggest, reaching 3.55 at the maximum:

    ========  ======  ======  ======  ========
    quantile     p50     p90     p99      max
    ratio       0.99    1.72    2.88     3.55
    ========  ======  ======  ======  ========

    That puts the false-failure rate at 5.1% per column for a multiple of 2 and
    0.7% for 3. Three is the better trade because a fidelity report is used as a
    gate, and a gate that cries wolf gets ignored.

    What that costs is worth stating plainly. At 20k rows the check reliably
    catches a 5% shift in a category's share, and a 2% shift in a
    *low*-cardinality column. A 2% shift spread across a 12-category column sits
    at 1.8x the noise floor and is **not** detectable at any sane multiple — it
    is genuinely indistinguishable from sampling variation at that row count.
    Detecting it needs more rows, not a looser threshold.
