"""Turn a profile (and optionally a structure) into a runnable design spec.

This is where the two inputs meet. The **profile** knows how the data is
distributed and how it behaves; the **structure** knows which fields must exist,
in what order, and with what declared type. Where they disagree the structure
wins on schema — it is the contract — and the profile wins on distribution — it
is the evidence.

The output is a spec you can run immediately and edit afterwards. Anything
inferred with low confidence carries a ``review`` note naming what to check,
because a spec that hides its guesses is worse than one that admits them.
