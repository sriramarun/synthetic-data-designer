"""Learn dynamics from a multi-cut-off sample.

A single snapshot tells you what a portfolio looks like. A panel tells you how
it *behaves*, and behaviour is what the ageing engine needs. Given the same
loans observed month after month, this module recovers:

- the **state machine** — which delinquency states exist and how often loans move
  between them, counted directly rather than hand-set;
- the **attrition rate** — how many entities leave the pool each period, which is
  the prepayment hazard;
- the **amortisation kind** — by testing the observed balance paths against each
  kernel and seeing which one predicts them;
- **counters** — columns that move by a fixed step every period;
- **index drift** — the average growth of valuation columns.

Everything here is measurement, not assumption. Where a measurement is thin
(too few observed transitions, say) it is reported with its sample size so the
number can be judged rather than trusted blindly.
