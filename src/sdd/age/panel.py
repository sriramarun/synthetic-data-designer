"""The ageing loop: turn a period-0 book into a panel.

One pass per cut-off. The order below is not arbitrary — each step depends on the
one before it:

1. **Lifecycle step.** Who prepaid, who fell behind, who charged off. Everything
   downstream keys off the new state.
2. **Counters.** Seasoning up, remaining term down.
3. **Amortisation.** Only the entities the lifecycle says are paying.
4. **Indices.** House prices, residual values, whatever the spec overlays.
5. **Accruals.** Arrears grow for another missed payment.
6. **State overrides.** ``state_fields`` is applied last among the value steps so
   a forced value always wins — a redeemed loan's balance is 0 regardless of what
   the amortisation kernel computed.
7. **Per-period derivations.** Ratios and buckets, computed from final values so
   an LTV always matches the balance printed beside it.
8. **Emit**, then drop anything terminal before the next period.

A terminal row is written *once* — the period it goes terminal shows the final
zero balance — and then leaves the pool. That is what makes this a closed pool
with attrition rather than a fixed panel.
