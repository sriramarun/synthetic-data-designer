"""Local web UI — a thin HTTP layer over :mod:`sdd.api`.

Deliberately thin, and deliberately local. Every endpoint here is a few lines
that unpack a request, call one `api` function, and return its dict. If an
endpoint needed real logic, the logic would belong in `api` where the CLI can
reach it too.

Four design choices worth stating:

**Runs happen on a worker thread, not in the request.**
    A 500k-row run takes minutes. The endpoint returns a job id immediately and
    the browser polls for progress, so nothing depends on an HTTP connection
    staying open.

**A spec is edited as JSON and validated on every change.**
    The browser holds the whole spec and posts it back to ``/api/check`` as the
    user edits. Validation lives in one place — the same loader the CLI uses —
    so the UI cannot accept a spec the engine would reject.

**Uploads are remembered as a source, not as two loose files.**
    A schema and a sample belong together: the schema fixes the columns, the
    sample supplies the distributions, and the deep generation methods need the
    sample again at run time. One token ties them, and the browser passes it
    along instead of re-uploading or re-profiling.

**Downloads are confined to the job's own directory.**
    Paths are resolved and checked against the workspace root before anything is
    served, because a filename arriving from a browser is untrusted input.
