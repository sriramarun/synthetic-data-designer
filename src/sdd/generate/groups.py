"""Parent records several entities share.

The entity stays the unit of the panel. A group is the thing behind several of
them — the obligor behind three facilities, the household behind a mortgage and
a buy-to-let, the dealer behind a month of car loans.

What makes this more than a category column is that a group carries its *own*
attributes, generated once and identical for every member. Three facilities lent
to the same company must agree about that company's industry and revenue.
Generated per facility they would disagree, and any analysis by obligor becomes
meaningless.

The state has to outlive a single book. A pool that reinvests builds later
cohorts from the same spec, and a facility acquired in month twenty may belong to
an obligor created in month one — so the group table is carried through ageing
rather than rebuilt, and later cohorts either attach to a group that exists or
mint a new one.
