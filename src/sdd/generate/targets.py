"""Aim a column's total at a stated aggregate.

A spec's generators draw each entity independently, so the portfolio's total is
whatever those draws happen to sum to. Real deals have a size — EUR 500m of
collateral, not "however much 500 loans came to" — and this closes that gap.

The approach is to scale the *generator* so the expected total lands on the
target, rather than to rescale the values after drawing them. Two reasons:

**Reinvestment.** A pool that buys new collateral builds later cohorts from the
same spec. Rescale only the opening book and every facility acquired afterwards
is drawn at the unscaled size — a portfolio whose new assets are three times the
size of its original ones. Scaling the generator applies everywhere for free.

**Legibility.** The scaled spec is the spec the user downloads, so the number
they see is the number that ran.

The cost is honest and worth stating: the realised total varies around the
target by ordinary sampling error, a few per cent at a few hundred entities.
This aims; it does not guarantee.
