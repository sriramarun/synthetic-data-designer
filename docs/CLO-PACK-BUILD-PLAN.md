# European CLO pack — build plan

Seven stages taking `clo_eu_leveraged_loans` from nothing to a deployed
calibrated pack. Built from the v1 specification (26pp), checked against the
engine as it stands at `a177797`.

**Total: 9–12 engineer-weeks.** First demoable pack in 2 weeks.

## The sequencing decision

The per-period portfolio metrics — the nineteen monthly figures in §17, "the
standard report" — are deferred to Stage 4, behind the generator, the obligor
model and validation. That is the right call for demo risk: Stage 1 puts a
working CLO on screen in two weeks.

One consequence, accepted deliberately: three of the four required charts *are*
report figures drawn over time, so charts must follow metrics. Stage 5 sits
behind Stage 4, and until both land the CLO results screen shows the generic
mortgage charts, which are meaningless for company loans. Building the chart
aggregations inline in Stage 1 and rewiring them later costs roughly a week of
rework and is not recommended.

## Dependencies

```
0 Spikes → 1 Pack v0 → 3 Groups → 4 Report → 5 Charts → 6 Release
                ↕
           2 Targets  (parallel — no dependency either way)
```

## Effort

| Stage | Scope | Effort | Risk | Ships |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 · Spikes | Five unknowns resolved before committing | 3 days | Low | Estimates you can trust |
| 1 · Pack v0 | The CLO recipe, simplified | 2–2.5 wk | Med | Demoable CLO pack |
| 2 · Targets | Aggregate targets — hit €500m par | 0.5–1 wk | Low | Realistic portfolio size |
| 3 · Groups | Obligors: one company, many facilities | 3–4 wk | **High** | Concentration analytics |
| 4 · Report | Per-period portfolio metrics | 1–1.5 wk | Low | Monthly report card |
| 5 · Charts | Metadata-driven charts | 1.5–2 wk | Med | CLO results screen |
| 6 · Release | Deployment, docs, release tests | 1 wk | Low | Public Space |

Estimates assume one engineer familiar with the codebase and include tests and
an artefact validator per stage. They do not include design iteration on
Stage 3, which is likely.

## Stage 0 — Spikes (3 days)

Five things that could not be settled by reading the code. Each moves an
estimate; two could change the pack's shape.

- **S0.1 Sticky exit dates.** Can a `when` derivation stamp `default_date` on
  first entry to Defaulted and never overwrite it? Derivations recompute every
  period, so a naive rule resets the date each cut-off. Affects ~12 columns
  (`default_date`, `recovery_date`, sale date). If not expressible, design an
  `on_entry` extension to `state_fields`.
- **S0.2 Transition matrix shape.** Confirm 8 states with 4 terminal works:
  matrix over the 4 non-terminal states, exits to terminal inside each row.
- **S0.3 Custom-SQL reach.** Write the three hardest §20 invariants as
  `CustomInvariant` SQL: portfolio reconciliation, no acquisitions after
  reinvestment end, obligor concentration. Proves ~25 checks are YAML.
- **S0.4 Reproducibility claim.** Same spec and seed twice; diff parquet bytes.
  Decides whether §29's "identical output" is byte- or logically identical.
- **S0.5 Rating as derivation.** Confirm a `bucket`/`when` derivation can produce
  BB…D from `credit_state` plus noise. This is the §7 escape; saves 3 weeks.

**Done when:** spike report on the branch answering all five with code that ran;
Stage 1–3 estimates revised; explicit go/no-go on the §7 simplification.

---

## Stage 1 — CLO pack v0 (2–2.5 weeks)

A working, demoable pack. Real lifecycle, reinvestment, defaults, recoveries and
scenarios. Deliberately missing: obligor grouping, target par, portfolio
metrics, CLO charts.

### Engine — small additions only

- **E1.1 `Scenario.recovery_multiplier`.** §15 requires adverse/severe to show
  lower recoveries; `Scenario` has no recovery knob. Mirrors
  `prepayment_multiplier`. ~30 lines plus tests.
- **E1.2 Exit-date stamping**, only if S0.1 says derivations cannot do it.

### Pack YAML — `packs/clo_eu_leveraged_loans.yaml`

- **P1.1** Deal and reporting fields (§6A) — 7 columns. Names must read as
  obviously synthetic: *Synthetic CLO Europe 2026-1*.
- **P1.2** Facility identifiers (§6B) — 9 columns. `facility_id` from a sequence
  generator; `months_to_maturity` and `months_in_portfolio` as period-stage
  derivations.
- **P1.3** Obligor characteristics (§6C) — 9 columns. *v0 simplification:*
  `obligor_id` is 1:1 with `facility_id`. Corrected in Stage 3.
- **P1.4** Facility economics (§6D) — 15 columns. Bullet amortisation dominant;
  `all_in_coupon_pct` derived from reference rate, spread and floor.
- **P1.5** Credit fields (§7) — 12 columns. `credit_state` from the lifecycle;
  ratings derived per S0.5.
- **P1.6** Eligibility flags (§8) — 10 required, 3 optional. All derivations.
- **P1.7** Lifecycle (§9–10) — 8 states; `terminal: [Prepaid, Matured, Sold,
  Recovered]`; matrix over the 4 non-terminal states;
  `DwellTimeHazard(Defaulted → Recovered)` for the recovery lag.
- **P1.8** Reinvestment (§11) — `originations` with `end_period: 24`. The stop
  date already exists in the engine; §11 assumed otherwise.
- **P1.9** Recovery — `dynamics.recovery` with rate, balance column, `on_states`.
- **P1.10** Market price — an `Index` with drift and `volatility` on
  `current_market_price`; `market_value` derived from par × price.
- **P1.11** Industry and geography (§13–14) — weighted categoricals, documented
  as configurable demo assumptions, not market estimates.
- **P1.12** Scenarios (§15) — base/adverse/severe via `default_multiplier`,
  `prepayment_multiplier`, `index_shift` on price, new `recovery_multiplier`.
- **P1.13** Emit — `synthetic_clo_{yyyymm}.csv` plus the consolidated panel.

### Validation

- **V1.1** Built-in toggles. `closed_pool` off — this pool is open.
- **V1.2** ~22 custom SQL invariants (§20). Concentration deferred to Stage 3.

### Tests — `tests/test_clo_pack.py`

Pack loads and validates; 500 × 36 completes; all invariants pass. Scenario
ordering regression (§15, §31 B–C). Reproducibility (§31 D). Terminal states, no
resurrection (§31 F). Reinvestment window (§31 E). RMBS and Auto still green.

**Done when:** §29 items 1–11 and 15–19 pass; default run completes inside the
Space limits; pack card loadable with no file; suite green, ruff clean.

---

## Stage 2 — Aggregate targets (0.5–1 week, parallelisable)

Generate facility sizes summing to a stated total. Today balances are drawn
independently and the portfolio total lands wherever it lands.

```yaml
entity:
  targets:
    - column: current_par
      total: 500_000_000
      method: proportional   # or: iterative
      tolerance: 0.005
```

- **A2.1** `Target` model on `entity`, validated against declared numeric columns.
- **A2.2** Apply in `book.py` after sampling and *after* randomness, before
  derivations. Rescale before noise and the noise breaks the total.
- **A2.3** Decide and document whether reinvestment cohorts re-target or inherit
  the opening scale. Recommendation: inherit, so the portfolio can shrink.
- **A2.4** Derived columns (`market_value`, `original_par_acquired`) must be
  computed after rescaling.

**Done when:** 500 facilities sum to €500m within tolerance across seeds; derived
columns consistent; RMBS and Auto unaffected.

---

## Stage 3 — Group entities (3–4 weeks) — the blocker

One company, many loans. 500 facilities across ~225 obligors, where facilities of
the same obligor agree on industry, country, revenue, EBITDA and leverage.
Roughly half the total engineering.

**Why it is hard:** `build_book()` runs twice — once for the opening portfolio,
again inside `originate()` for every reinvestment cohort. The obligor table
cannot be a build-time artefact; it must be run state carried through ageing,
because a facility acquired in month 20 may belong to an obligor created in
month 1.

```yaml
groups:
  obligor:
    key: obligor_id
    count: 225                 # or ratio: 0.45
    id_format: "OBL{seq:05d}"
    assignment: {kind: zipf, concentration: 1.15}
    new_group_rate: 0.6        # share of acquisitions that are new obligors
    columns:
      - {name: industry,    generator: {...}}
      - {name: revenue_eur, generator: {...}}
constraints:
  - kind: max_group_share
    group: obligor
    column: current_par
    max: 0.025
```

- **G3.1** `Group` model plus `DesignSpec.groups`, with validation.
- **G3.2** `book.py` — build the group table, sample assignments, left-join.
  Accept an existing table so later cohorts reuse it.
- **G3.3** `panel.py` — carry the group table as run state alongside `dwell` and
  `accrual_counters`; pass to `originate()`; attach-or-create per
  `new_group_rate`.
- **G3.4** `api.py` — thread through; record group summary in `run_manifest.json`.
- **G3.5** New invariant toggle `group_columns_stable` — group attributes
  identical across every facility of a group, every period.
- **G3.6** Concentration cap — post-generation rebalancing. Without it the 2.5%
  invariant simply fails on skewed facility sizes.
- **G3.7** Concentration invariants (§20), now meaningful.
- **G3.8** **Profiler support** — detect a repeated key, measure the
  facilities-per-group distribution, identify group-constant columns, emit a
  `groups:` block in the learned spec. Not optional: without it, profiling a real
  CLO tape silently discards the obligor structure.
- **G3.9** Round-trip test mirroring `tests/test_originations.py`.
- **G3.10** CLO pack update — `obligor_id` from groups, 225 obligors, 2.5% cap.

**Done when:** ~225 obligors with consistent attributes; no obligor over 2.5% of
par across seeds and scenarios; reinvestment attaches and creates; profile →
spec → generate recovers the group structure; §12 satisfied.

---

## Stage 4 — The standard report (1–1.5 weeks)

*Deferred by request.* A generic per-period metrics layer, and the 19 P0 figures
the CLO pack needs from it. Today the engine emits only a per-period state count.

```yaml
metrics:
  - {name: collateral_par,      kind: sum,             column: current_par}
  - {name: wa_spread,           kind: weighted_mean,   column: spread_bps, weight: current_par}
  - {name: ccc_par_pct,         kind: share_where,     column: current_par, where: "ccc_flag == 'Y'"}
  - {name: largest_obligor_pct, kind: max_group_share, group: obligor, column: current_par}
  - {name: cumulative_defaults, kind: cumulative,      column: defaulted_par}
```

- **M4.1** Seven metric kinds — `sum`, `count`, `distinct_count`,
  `weighted_mean`, `share_where`, `max_group_share`, `cumulative` — cover all 19
  P0 figures in §17.
- **M4.2** New module `src/sdd/metrics.py`.
- **M4.3** Hook in `run_ageing` alongside `mix`, inside the existing per-period
  loop. No second traverse.
- **M4.4** Output `portfolio_metrics.parquet` and `.csv`.
- **M4.5** Metric series in the `api.run` payload.
- **M4.6** Sixth download format.
- **M4.7** CLO metrics (§17) — all 19 P0. P1 metrics deferred; §17 warns off
  proprietary agency calculations and that warning should be honoured.
- **M4.8** Reconciliation invariant (§20) — portfolio totals tie to
  facility-level totals. This is what makes the report trustworthy.
- **M4.9** Prove genericity — add three metrics to the RMBS pack (WA coupon, WA
  seasoning, arrears share). If they do not fall out naturally, the abstraction
  is wrong.

**Done when:** all 19 P0 metrics per cut-off; reconciliation invariant passes;
RMBS carries metrics with no CLO-specific code; §29 item 12 passes.

---

## Stage 5 — CLO charts (1.5–2 weeks)

Charts as configuration. Today `build_charts()` returns four fixed keys and the
browser has four hardcoded hosts with bespoke renderers — mortgage-shaped.

```yaml
results:
  charts:
    - {type: series,         title: "Portfolio par",          metric: collateral_par}
    - {type: stacked_series, title: "Credit state",           states: [Performing, Watchlist, Distressed, Defaulted]}
    - {type: series,         title: "CCC share",              metric: ccc_par_pct}
    - {type: category_bar,   title: "Industry concentration", group: industry, column: current_par}
```

- **C5.1** Four types — `series`, `stacked_series`, `histogram`, `category_bar`.
  Only `category_bar` is genuinely new.
- **C5.2** `charts.py` — generic builders. Series charts become thin reads of
  Stage 4 metrics rather than fresh aggregations.
- **C5.3** `app.js` — render by declared type into dynamic hosts, replacing the
  four fixed `#chart-*` divs and their bespoke renderers.
- **C5.4** `index.html` — four fixed containers become one loop target.
- **C5.5** RMBS and Auto migrated to configuration. This is the regression risk:
  shipped, screenshotted behaviour must not change.
- **C5.6** Graceful absence — a missing metric degrades with a readable message.

**Done when:** four CLO charts render from configuration; RMBS and Auto visually
unchanged with screenshots compared; no `if pack == "clo"` in the UI (§18).

---

## Stage 6 — Deployment, docs, release tests (1 week)

- **R6.1** `push_to_space.sh` already copies the whole `packs/` directory —
  verify rather than change. No new runtime deps, no PyTorch, CPU only.
- **R6.2** Resource check — 500 × 36 is ~20–25k rows, far inside
  `SDD_MAX_RECORDS=50000` and `SDD_MAX_ROWS=2500000`. Confirm on the live Space
  for all three scenarios.
- **R6.3** Privacy copy (§25) — use the specified wording. Nothing may weaken the
  existing shared-instance warning.
- **R6.4** Space card mentions CLO support.
- **R6.5** Documentation (§26) — README, User Guide, pack comparison table, and a
  new section explaining CLO concepts for readers who have never seen one.
- **R6.6** Scope statement — v1 models the collateral portfolio, not tranche
  waterfalls, and produces no investment recommendations.
- **R6.7** Screenshots — re-run the existing Playwright capture script.
- **R6.8** Release tests A–F (§31).

**Done when:** every §29 checkbox ticked; release tests pass on the deployed
Space, not just locally; deployed *from `main`*, after merge.

---

## Working agreements

1. **One PR per stage, merged before the next begins.** Twice now, work has been
   stranded on a branch behind an already-merged PR and silently missed `main`.
   Always branch from a freshly pulled `main`.
2. **Deploy only from `main`.** The Space once ran code that existed on no merged
   branch, and input validation everyone believed was live had never shipped.
3. **Every stage gets unit tests and an artefact validator** that re-derives the
   output independently. `pytest` green and `ruff` clean before commit.
4. **Generic before specific.** No `if pack == "clo"` branches — the spec asks
   for this explicitly, and it is what makes the fourth pack cheap.

## Risk register

| Risk | Stage | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Group design needs a second pass | 3 | High | Most likely single overrun. Spike assignment and persistence on paper first; timebox design to two days |
| Sticky exit dates not expressible | 0–1 | Med | S0.1 exists for this. ~3 days for an `on_entry` extension if it fails |
| Chart refactor breaks RMBS or Auto | 5 | Med | Migrate existing charts to config first and prove them unchanged |
| Concentration invariant fails on skewed sizes | 3 | Med | G3.6 rebalancing is a requirement. Test across seeds and scenarios |
| Profiler support deferred, product inconsistent | 3 | Med | Saves ~1.5 weeks and leaves profiling silently lossy. Decide explicitly |
| Scenario ordering not deterministic enough to test | 1 | Low | Test ordering with margin, not exact values, per §15 |
| "Byte-identical" reproducibility unachievable | 0 | Low | S0.4 settles it; soften §29 wording if parquet embeds metadata |

## Explicitly out of scope

Per §28, v1 excludes the entire liability side: tranches, interest and principal
waterfalls, OC and IC diversion mechanics, management fees, tranche pricing and
cash flows, equity IRR, call economics, and any replication of rating-agency
models.

Also deferred within this plan: P1 metrics (§17) — rating factor, portfolio
turnover, diversity proxy; the sector stress overlay (§16), which the spec itself
marks P1; and true rating migration (§7), replaced by a derived rating under the
spec's own escape clause.

These belong to the Phase 2 CLO Laboratory, and starting them before the
collateral generator is validated would be the wrong order.
